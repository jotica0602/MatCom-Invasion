## Description

The dark skies over Earth announce an imminent threat: an alien invasion is underway. The enemies from outer space have launched an offensive against the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Havana, and humanity relies on your skills to repel the invasion. You will embark on a dangerous mission to defend our home from the alien invaders, using your tactical and combat skills to ensure the survival of humanity.

# Objective

Develop an arcade-style game in C, similar to the classic "Space Invaders", where the player controls a spaceship to defend Earth from an alien invasion. This project aims to put into practice fundamental concepts of the Operating Systems subject, such as **event-driven programming, concurrency, memory management, and planning strategies**. 

# Theoretical Elements

## Event-Driven Programming

The implementation of the game will require the use of event-driven programming to handle player interactions with the game environment. This involves detecting events like keyboard input and responding to them appropriately, such as moving the player's ship or firing projectiles.

## Concurrency Using Threads

To enhance the gaming experience and manage multiple aspects simultaneously, threads will be used to execute tasks in parallel. For example, one thread could be responsible for listening to events, while another could handle the game logic.

## Planning Strategies

The game design will include the implementation of a planning strategy to determine how enemies appear. Some strategies could be FCFS (First Come, First Served), SJF (Shortest Job First), SRTN (Shortest Remaining Time Next), or other relevant strategies to ensure a challenging yet fair gaming experience.

## Page Replacement Algorithm

Luckily, the aliens' trajectory to Earth is ordered. They don't always fall in the same place. It is part of your mission to implement an algorithm to know where the enemies will land. As on Earth we help each other, the title of this section will guide you with this task.

## Where It Will Be

You will present and defend your project on a virtual machine with Arch Linux operating system, demonstrating your understanding and skills in a coherent development environment. You should locate the executable of your game with the system binaries. This should be run by typing MatComInvasion in the console.
